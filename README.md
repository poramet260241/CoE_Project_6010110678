# Design and development tracking system based in IoT for bike sharing
## Computer Engineering Project (Prince of Songkla Univerity)
### Abstract
    Design and development tracking system based in IoT for bike sharing is a computer engineering project that created because I have seen a problem to use public bike service such as, at first using the user must install the application and register this after that user must go to public bike to QR code scan for unlocking this bike to use it. I think those steps are unnecessary. because public bikes should be a service that you can use by not register. If you do not have a smartphone then you cannot use the service. Which should not be like that. So, I will make the public bikes service that anyone can use even if they do not have a smartphone. I will create a web application, so you do not have to download it. My web application only serves to locate each public bicycle. It does not have a locking system. So, my service will make it easier for you to find public bikes.
